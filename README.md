## 📚Introduction
This is the third project of Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree Program and is in collaboration with IBM. In this project, 
we'll analyze the interactions users have with articles in the IBM Watson Studio platform and make recommendations for new articles that we think they'll like.

## 📌Motivation
For this project, I'll be looking at the interactions users have with articles in the IBM Watson Studio platform. In this way, when each individual enters their account, 
they will be able to receive recommendations according to their profile.

## 🔌Installation
Developed with Python 3 with libraries of:
  * pandas 
  * numpy
  * matplotlib
  * project_tests
  * pickle 
  
## 📁File Descriptions
  * Recommendations_with_IBM.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing implementation and analysis developed in the following segments I) Exploratory Data Analysis, II) Rank Based Recommendations, III) User-User Based Collaborative Filtering, IV) Matrix Factorization
  * Recommendations_with_IBM.html: A copy of Recommendations_with_IBM.ipynb in html format.
